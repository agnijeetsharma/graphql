## 📚 Database Loader

### What is DataLoader?
**DataLoader** is a batching and caching utility for GraphQL (or any data-fetching scenario). It solves the **N+1 query problem** by combining multiple queries into a single batch request.

### ✨ Features of DataLoader:
- **Batching**: Collects multiple requests and executes them together.
- **Caching**: Stores already requested data to avoid duplicate queries.

---

### 📦 Installation
```bash
npm install dataloader
```

---

### 🤔 Why Use DataLoader?
Suppose there are **100 users**, and each user has **5 posts**.

#### Naive Resolver:
- **1 query** for users.
- **100 queries** for posts (one per user).
- **Total: 101 queries!** 😲

#### How DataLoader Fixes This:
Instead of running 100 separate queries, DataLoader groups them into a **single batch request**.

Now, only **2 queries** are executed:
1. Fetch all users.
2. Fetch all posts for these users in a single query.

---

### 🛠️ Example
Without batching:
```javascript
PostModel.find({ userId: 1 }); // Query 1
PostModel.find({ userId: 2 }); // Query 2
PostModel.find({ userId: 3 }); // Query 3
```

With batching:
```javascript
PostModel.find({ userId: { $in: [1, 2, 3] } }); // Single batch query
```

### 🌟 Benefits
- Reduces the number of database queries.
- Improves performance and scalability.
- Simplifies data-fetching logic.

### Subscription

GraphQL subscriptions allow real-time updates by maintaining a persistent connection between the client and server. Unlike queries and mutations (which are request-response based), subscriptions use WebSockets to push data updates to clients automatically.

  Client Subscribes → The client listens for a specific event (e.g., new messages in a chat).
🔹 Server Publishes → When an event occurs, the server sends real-time updates.
🔹 Client Receives → The subscribed client gets the latest data instantly.
